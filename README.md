This game is still in the middle of refactoring. Not all of its current functionality has been restored.
To execute the game, either drag the "game" folder onto love.exe, or run love.exe with the parameter game.

The game should be controllable with either keyboard or controller. However, currently there is no easy in-game key rebinding GUI. Furthermore, if no controller is connected at all, currently the game will crash on startup. (Whoops.)
